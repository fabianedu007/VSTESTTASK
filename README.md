# TEST TASK - VEEAM SOFTWARE - FABIAN ALBORNOZ

### GOAL: 
I need to synchronise two folders. A SOURCE folder an a replica FOLDER. 
If a file/folder exists in the SOURCE folder, it should also exist in the REPLICA folder.

### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: 
The programming language I will be using is Python. It is high-level, easy to read and has a rich library.

### SYNCHRONISATION IS ONE WAY:
Since synchronisation is from the SOURCE to the REPLICA folder only, if a file/folder exists in the REPLICA folder but does not exist in the SOURCE folder, it should be deleted from the REPLICA folder

### SYNCHRONISATION SHOULD BE PERIODIC
This verification should be performed regularly

### FILE OPERATIONS SHOULD BE LOGGED TO A FILE AND TO THE CONSOLE

### FOLDER PATH, SYNCHRONISATION INTERVAL AND LOG FILE PATH SHOUDLE BE PROVIDEDE USING THE COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS

### IT IS UNDESIRABLE TO USE THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES THAT IMPLEMENT FOLDER SYNCHRONIZATION

### IT IS ALLOWED (AND RECOMMENDED) TO USE EXTERNAL LIBRARIES IMPLEMENTING OTHER WELL-KNOWN ALGORITHMS. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS NO POINT IN IMPLEMENTING YET ANOTHER FUNCTION THAT CALCULATES MD5
